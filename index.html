      <h2>Forever Wild Nature Preserves</h2>
      <p/>The Forever Wild Program is an initiative of the NYC Department of Parks & Recreation to protect the most ecologically valuable lands within the five boroughs.
      There are 47 Forever Wild preserves, including over 8,700 acres of forests, wetlands, and meadows.
      For that reason, these areas provide important resting grounds for migratory birds.
      <p/>New York City is situated along the Atlantic Flyway, an avian migratory path stretching along the east coast from Nova Scotia to the southern tip of Florida.
      Visit a Forever Wild Preserve near you to see some of the following birds:
      <p/>
      <ul>
        <li>Barn owl</li>
        <li>Bald eagle</li>
        <li>Piping plover</li>
        <li>Peregrin falcon</li>
        <li>Great blue heron</li>
        <li>Yellow-crowned night-heron</li>
        <li>Green heron</li>

      </ul>
